**The files above**
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderREDUX.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderNVR.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderVISUALSV.zip
  - TimecyclesVisualsettingsLoaderQUANTV.zip

are 4 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no responsibility as to whether or not whatever particular trainer you may be using may be inferior in doing so.

**Vehicle Swaps**
I have preconfigured some popular vehicle swaps into easy one-click install OpenIV packages here:

To put your own swaps of other vehicles from https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles one must follow the practice of REPLACING a suitable vanilla vehicle, such as BUFFALO, POLICE3, BISON2, etc, by renaming the modded car files to a stock one, for example:

- DodgeCharger.yft
- DodgeCharger_hi.yft
- DodgeCharget.ytd
- DodgeCharger+hi.ytd

to...

- buffalo.yft
- buffalo_hi.yft
- buffalo.ytd
- buffalo+hi.yft

and replacing the vanilla models(yft) and textures(ytd) with the ones from the modded car.
Most common cars can be swapped in /mods/x64e.rpf, some cars may have been tweaked and changed by Rockstar in dlcs that have been issued, in which you would have to swap that NEWEST INSTANCE of a specific car.

**Xenos64 injector + pre-loaded config.zip**

Is a copy of the Xenos library injector, prepackaged with an injection config for use with the graphics retexture mod. Also included in the main retexture package 4GB ZIP. Your browser may flag the download as unsafe for this reason alone, especially Chrome.

**Recommended ENB configs**

Note about Redux, it should be known that JRomito has been caught stealing other people's work on 2 occasions to make his mods, however, a lot of people like Redux's timecycles/visualsettings files. Here is one of the articles in regards to Redux being stolen work, you make your own decision: https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-redux-mod-maker-accused-of-stealing-other-modders-work/
