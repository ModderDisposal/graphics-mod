are 4 different sets of timecycles, one or the other to be used at a time, and can only be used by a GTA V trainer capable of loading .ASI mods. Some GTA V trainers load ASI mods better than others. I take no responsibility as to whether or not whatever particular trainer you may be using may be inferior in doing so.

  
is an OpenIV install package for those who have already installed version 2.3 of graphics OIV install package, to quickly update it to version 2.4. Update puts certain procedural weeds and grasses back into the game which were previously used up until 1.46 DLC by modders to crash player's games. Also adds some map addons via MPAPARTMENTS DLC

**Xenos64 injector + pre-loaded config.zip**

Is a copy of the Xenos library injector, prepackaged with an injection config for use with the graphics retexture mod. Also included in the main retexture package 4GB ZIP

Note about Redux, it should be known that JRomito has been caught stealing other people's work on 2 occasions to make his mods, however, a lot of people like Redux's timecycles/visualsettings files. Here is one of the articles in regards to Redux being stolen work, you make your own decision: https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-5-redux-mod-maker-accused-of-stealing-other-modders-work/
